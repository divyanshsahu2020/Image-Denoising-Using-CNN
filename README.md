# Image-Denoising-Using-CNN

DESCRIPTION - To build a deep learning model that utilizes autoencoders in order to enhance noisy images by generating clear, noise-free counterparts. This model has the potential to significantly improve image quality across several domains like photography, medical imaging and computer vision applications.


INPUT DATASET - In order to implement this model an in-built fashion-MNIST dataset is used. 

OUTPUT - The noisy images are transformed into visually appealing and crisp images.



PYTHON BASED LIBRARIES USED - IPython, PIL, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, os, cv2, NumPy, SkLearn, Keras, random
